Introduction
This document provides guidance on the management of psychosocial risks and promoting well-being
at work, as part of an occupational health and safety (OH&S) management system.
This document is intended to be used together with ISO 45001, which contains requirements and
guidance on planning, implementing, reviewing, evaluating and improving an OH&S management
system. ISO 45001 highlights that the organization is responsible for the OH&S of workers and others
who can be affected by its activities. This responsibility includes promoting and protecting their
physical and psychological health.
The aim and intended outcomes of the OH&S management system are therefore to prevent workrelated injury and ill health to workers, and to provide safe and healthy workplaces. Consequently, it is
critically important for the organization to eliminate hazards and minimize OH&S risks by taking
effective preventive and protective measures, which include measures to manage psychosocial risks.
Psychosocial hazards are increasingly recognized as major challenges to health, safety and wellbeing at work.
Psychosocial hazards relate to how work is organized, social factors at work and aspects of the work
environment, equipment and hazardous tasks. Psychosocial hazards can be present in all
organizations and sectors, and from all kinds of work tasks, equipment and employment
arrangements.
Psychosocial hazards can occur in combination with one another and can influence and be influenced
by other hazards. Psychosocial risk relates to the potential of these types of hazards to cause several
types of outcomes on individual health, safety and well-being and on organizational performance and
sustainability. It is important that psychosocial risks are managed in a manner consistent with other
OH&S risks, through an OH&S management system, and integrated into the organization’s broader
business processes.
4
Psychosocial risks affect both psychological health and safety, and health, safety and well-being at
work more broadly. Psychosocial risks are also associated with economic costs to organizations and
society.
There are a range of terms that are used in relation to what psychosocial risks affect, including
“psychological health” and “mental health”. These terms are considered interchangeable and to have
the same meaning for the purposes of this document. This document is concerned with all types of
impacts on health, safety and well-being at work.
Negative outcomes for workers can include poor health and associated conditions (e.g.
cardiovascular disease, musculoskeletal disorders, diabetes, anxiety, depression, sleep disorders)
and associated poor health behaviours (e.g. substance misuse, unhealthy eating), as well as reduced
job satisfaction, commitment and productivity. Managing psychosocial risks can result in positive
outcomes, including improved job satisfaction and increased productivity.
Although numerous factors can determine the nature and severity of outcomes of psychosocial risks,
organizations have a significant role to play in eliminating hazards or minimizing risks. Both the
organization and workers have a shared responsibility for maintaining and improving health, safety
and well-being at work.
For the organization, the impact of psychosocial risks includes increased costs due to absence from
work, turnover, reduced product or service quality, recruitment and training, workplace investigations
and litigation, as well as damage to the organization’s reputation.
Effective management of psychosocial risk can lead to benefits such as improved worker
engagement, enhanced productivity, increased innovation and organizational sustainability.
This document outlines examples of psychosocial hazards arising from work organization, social
factors and work environment, equipment and hazardous tasks, as well as a range of control
measures that can be used to eliminate hazards or minimize associated risks.
Organizations are responsible for identifying hazards and minimizing the risks associated with them.
The participation of workers, in all stages of the process, is critical to the success of managing
psychosocial risks.
This document also includes information on what is important for organizations to consider in relation
to raising awareness of psychosocial risks, developing competence in the management of
psychosocial risks, supporting the recovery and return to work of affected workers, and planning for
and responding to emergency situations.
The success of psychosocial risk management depends on commitment from all levels and functions
of the organization, especially from top management.

4 Context of the organization
4.1 Understanding the organization and its context
4.1.1 General
In relation to managing psychosocial risk, the organization should:
• a) consider the external and internal issues that can affect the achievement of the intended
outcomes of the OH&S management system;
• b) understand the needs and expectations of workers and other relevant interested parties;
• c) consider which of these needs and expectations are, or could become, legal requirements
and other requirements;
• d) adjust the design of activities to manage psychosocial risk to suit the specific context of the
workplace;
• e) tailor activities to improve the focus, reliability, validity and effectiveness of the process to
manage psychosocial risk;
• f) determine how the assessment of psychosocial risks will be used to make effective action
plans.
4.1.2 External issues
The organization should determine external issues relevant to achieving the intended outcomes of the
OH&S management system in relation to psychosocial risk. External issues can include:
6
• a) the supply chain in which the organization operates, as this can affect psychosocial
hazards and their associated risks (e.g. through time pressure, schedules or production
pressure);
• b) relationships with contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, providers and other interested
parties;
• c) the sharing of workplaces, resources and equipment with other parties (e.g. if the
organization collaborates with other organizations on worksites);
• d) customer and/or client requirements for service provision (e.g. customer/client
requirements can affect psychosocial hazards through violence, harassment, time pressure);
• e) economic conditions that can affect availability, duration and location of work;
• f) the nature of work contracts, remuneration, employment conditions and industrial relations;
• g) the demographics of workers who are available for work (e.g. young or ageing workers,
increasing retirement ages, gender);
• h) rapid technological changes (e.g. increased connectivity to electronic devices, impact of
artificial intelligence and automation technology);
• i) labour force mobility, creating greater diversity among workers with different backgrounds
and cultures, and speaking different languages;
• j) the wider context of the organization’s geographical region, including social, economic and
public health issues (e.g. pandemics, natural disasters, financial crises).
4.1.3 Internal issues
Internal issues that can affect the intended outcomes of the OH&S management system in relation to
psychosocial risk can include:
• a) how the organization is governed and managed (e.g. its organizational structure,
assignment of roles and responsibilities, effectiveness and efficiency of its formal and informal
decision-making processes, organizational culture, management style, communication style,
respect for privacy);
• b) the organization’s level of commitment and direction with respect to psychological health,
safety and well-being at work, as set out in policy statements, guidelines, objectives and
strategies;
• c) other management systems adopted by the organization that can interact with the
management of psychosocial risks (e.g. based on ISO 9001 and ISO 14001);
• d) size and nature of the organization’s workforce (e.g. large, small, complex or highly
decentralized);
• e) characteristics of workers and the workforce (e.g. gender, age, ethnicity, religion, disability,
language, literacy and numeracy);
• f) competence of workers to recognize psychosocial hazards and manage risks;
• g) locations of work (e.g. itinerant workforce without a fixed workplace, working remotely,
working at home, working in isolation or working in remote locations such as rurally);
• h) workers’ terms and conditions (e.g. flexible work arrangements, compensation and
benefits, part-time, casual or temporary workforce);
• i) adequacy and availability of resources (see 7.1).
4.2 Understanding the needs and expectations of workers and other interested
parties
In relation to managing psychosocial risk, the organization should understand and determine the
needs and expectations of workers and other interested parties.
Workers and other interested parties have a range of needs and expectations that can be influenced
by psychosocial risks at work. These needs and expectations can include:
• — financial security;
• — social interaction and support;
• — inclusion, recognition, reward and accomplishment;
• — personal development and growth;
7
• — equal opportunity and fair treatment at work.
Needs and expectations can be included in legal requirements (e.g. OH&S and human rights
legislation), collective agreements, and voluntary agreements and other requirements to which the
organization subscribes or adheres.
4.3 Determining the scope of the OH&S management system
The organization should confirm that the scope of its OH&S management system and its operations
and activities with respect to the management of psychosocial risk are specifically addressed by the
organization’s OH&S management system.
4.4 OH&S management system
The organization should ensure that its OH&S management system remains appropriate, effective
and relevant to its operations and activities with respect to its management of psychosocial risk.
5 Leadership and worker participation
5.1 Leadership and commitment
The successful management of psychosocial risk calls for a commitment throughout the organization.
Top management should lead this, and managers and workers at all levels should assist in its
implementation. Top management should:
• a) demonstrate leadership and commitment to managing psychosocial risk and to promoting
well-being at work;
• b) identify, monitor and be aware of its roles and responsibilities with respect to managing
psychosocial risks;
• c) determine the resources needed and make them available in a timely and efficient manner;
• d) reinforce the sustainability of managing psychosocial risk by including it in strategic plans
and existing systems, processes and reporting structures;
• e) protect workers from reprisals and/or threats of reprisals for reporting incidents, hazards,
risks and opportunities;
• f) communicate how whistle-blowers, victims, witnesses and those who report or raise
workplace psychosocial risk concerns will be protected;
• g) obtain and provide feedback to determine the effectiveness of managing and preventing
psychosocial risk within the OH&S management system, both in implementation and
operation;
• h) empower workers and ensure they are competent to fulfil their roles and responsibilities to
identify and manage psychosocial risk;
• i) remove barriers that can limit worker participation, and aim to enhance participation;
• j) actively engage workers in a continual dialogue on the management of psychosocial risk;
• k) support and encourage workers to actively participate in the management of psychosocial
risk in the workplace
5.2 OH&S policy
5.2.1 In establishing an OH&S policy for the organization, top management should:
• a) ensure that commitments to preventing ill health and injuries related to psychosocial risk
and promoting well-being at work are included in the OH&S policy;
• b) determine if there is a need for a separate policy about managing psychosocial risk;
• c) consider how other policies (e.g. human resources, corporate social responsibility) support
and are consistent with the OH&S policy to achieve common objectives.
5.2.2 The OH&S policy should:
8
• a) be appropriate to the purpose, size and context of the organization;
• b) include a commitment to fulfil legal requirements and other requirements related to health,
safety and well-being at work, including a commitment to manage psychosocial risk;
• c) provide a framework for setting and reviewing, evaluating and revising objectives for the
management of psychosocial risk;
• d) promote and enhance a working environment consistent with the principles of dignity,
mutual respect, confidentiality, cooperation and trust in the OH&S management system;
• e) be communicated to all workers so that they are aware of their rights and responsibilities;
f) be reviewed periodically to ensure it remains relevant and appropriate to the organization.
The organization should consult workers and, where they exist, worker representatives in the
development of a policy to manage psychosocial risk and, where relevant, consult other interested
parties.
Policy related to psychosocial risk can provide direction for implementing and improving management
of psychosocial risk within the general OH&S management system. The policy can enable top
management and other workers to understand the overall commitment of the organization and how
this can affect individual responsibilities. The organization should consider if a specific policy to
manage psychosocial risk is necessary.
5.3 Organizational roles, responsibilities and authorities
Top management is responsible for the functioning of the OH&S management system and should
clarify roles, responsibilities and authorities for managing psychosocial risk in the workplace. The
effective management of psychosocial risks within a workplace requires workers with different roles to
work together effectively (e.g. human resources, line managers, workers with specific OH&S
responsibilities).
The organization should promote and support worker involvement in actively managing psychosocial
risks.
5.4 Consultation and participation of workers
Consultation and participation of workers and, where they exist, worker representatives is essential
for the development, planning, implementation, maintenance, evaluation and continual improvement
of healthy and safe workplaces and the success of the process(es) to manage psychosocial risk.
In addition to the general requirements in ISO 45001:2018, 5.4, the organization should:
• a) provide opportunities for feedback by workers to help the organization determine the
effectiveness of the management of psychosocial risks;
• b) encourage participation and engagement, e.g. in health and safety committees or peer-topeer support networks if appropriate to the size and context of the organization. In smaller
organizations, where formal worker representation can be lacking, this consultation process
should be undertaken directly with workers. Consultation between the organization and
workers should take place at all stages of managing psychosocial risk, taking into account the
experience and expertise of workers. Both the organization and its workers have specific
roles and responsibilities. Health and safety committees, work councils or other
representation bodies also have an important role to play.
Involvement in decision-making processes can increase a worker’s motivation and commitment to
contribute to psychologically healthy and safe workplaces. Being encouraged and supported to
participate, rather than feeling forced to take part, is more likely to be effective and sustainable.
Some of the concerns about engaging workers can include worries about pushback, negative
attitudes, apathy and the sensitive nature of the impact of psychosocial hazards. Any of these
concerns can come from unsuccessful past initiatives. For these reasons, care should be taken to
address the concerns of workers and other interested parties when establishing the OH&S
management system, and participation and consultation should be encouraged. Engaging worker
representatives, where they exist, can help prevent or minimize worker concerns.
9
Organizations should also support ongoing consultation, participation and engagement, and get input
at all stages of planning and implementation. Active and meaningful involvement of relevant
interested parties is an important factor for the management of psychosocial risks in any organization.
6 Planning
6.1 Actions to address risks and opportunities
6.1.1 General
6.1.1.1 The organization should consider the issues referred to in Clause 4 and determine the risks
and opportunities that need to be addressed, including:
• a) psychosocial hazards;
• b) prevention of injury and ill-health;
• c) strategies for workers returning to work;
• d) opportunities for improvement, including promotion of well-being at work;
• e) the development, review and maintenance of systems, processes and reporting structures
with relevance to the management of psychosocial risk.
The organization should prioritize actions based on its assessment of psychosocial risks.
6.1.1.2 The organization should use the planning process to:
• a) establish appropriate objectives;
• b) determine how to achieve the objectives for the management of psychosocial risk and fulfil
legal requirements and other requirements;
• c) demonstrate a commitment to continual improvement that, where possible, goes beyond
fulfilling legal requirements.
6.1.1.3 During the planning process, the organization should take into account:
• a) the needs and expectations of particular groups of workers (e.g. workers working alone,
remote workers, minority groups);
• b) the needs of specific workplaces or sets of operations or work tasks;
• c) the results of the assessment of psychosocial risks, to understand their nature and the
underlying causes;
• d) the implementation of actions designed to eliminate psychosocial hazards and reduce the
associated risks;
• e) the evaluation of those actions and their outcomes;
• f) the management of the process by reviewing and updating it to meet changing needs,
recognizing good practice;
• g) the resources needed;
• h) how to actively involve workers through consultation and participation.
6.1.2 Hazard identification and assessment of risks and opportunities
6.1.2.1 Hazard identification
6.1.2.1.1 The organization should:
• a) understand the underlying sources of harm before control measures are considered to
improve the effectiveness of activities to manage psychosocial risk;
• b) establish, implement and maintain processes for hazard identification that are ongoing and
proactive.
6.1.2.1.2 The organization should identify hazards of a psychosocial nature. These can include:
10
• a) aspects of how work is organized (for examples, see Table 1);

16
6.1.2.1.3 The organization should establish, implement and maintain ongoing and proactive
processes for identifying psychosocial hazards. This can be done by, for example:
• a) reviewing job descriptions;
• b) analysing work tasks, schedules and locations;
• c) consulting with workers, clients and other interested parties at regular intervals;
• d) analysing performance evaluations, worker surveys, standardized questionnaires, audits,
etc.;
• e) holding interviews, group discussions or using checklists;
• f) conducting workplace inspections and observations which help to understand how work is
carried out, and how workers interact with one another;
• g) reviewing relevant documented information such as incident reports, hazard and risk
reports, grouped occupational health statistics, workers’ compensation claims, worker
surveys, absenteeism and worker turnover data.
NOTE 1 Where documented information can identify specific workers, it is important to
aggregate (group) the data to ensure individual worker privacy is respected and specific
workers cannot be identified. The organization is expected to take into account the
knowledge, expertise and competence of workers in relation to their jobs and consult with
relevant workers and worker representatives, where they exist, in psychosocial hazard
identification and how their work is designed and performed.
When identifying psychosocial hazards, organizations should take into account that psychosocial
hazards interact with each other and with other types of hazards in the work environment. For
example, psychosocial hazards can increase the risk of exposure to other hazards through human
error, increased time pressure or social/cultural expectations about how to work with other hazards.
More adverse effects can occur within the same levels of exposure when working in conditions that
include uncontrolled psychosocial risks.
Organizations should take into account how exposure to other hazards (e.g. biological hazards,
airborne contaminants, working at height, confined spaces) can also contribute to psychosocial risks,
as workers can worry about the possible implications of such exposures or experiences. Hazardous
manual tasks (e.g. lifting, repetitive movements) are known to interact with psychosocial hazards and
to influence outcomes such as musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs).
The organization should take into account human factors in relation to psychosocial hazards in all
parts of an OH&S management system. Human factors represent the abilities and limitations of
people, and therefore are relevant to the success or otherwise of risk assessment, risk controls and
the design, implementation and effectiveness of work tasks or processes. Awareness of human
factors when designing and re-designing work can lead to more positive outcomes in relation to workrelated ill health and injury.
A range of methods can be used to analyse human factors relevant to particular work tasks, including
observation, consultation, task analysis techniques and specialized audits. Identifying which human
factors are relevant to specific work tasks can, in some circumstances, be complex and require
specialized advice or knowledge.
NOTE 2 Further information on human factors can be found in ISO 10075-2 and ISO 6385.
6.1.2.2 Assessment of risks and opportunities
The organization should assess the risks related to the identified psychosocial hazards (see 6.1.2)
and seek opportunities to reduce risks and drive continual improvement. This assessment should:
• a) provide information about the potential harm;
• b) compare groups that differ in exposure to, or reporting of, psychosocial hazards;
• c) consider the interaction of psychosocial risks with risks from other identified hazards;
• d) prioritize hazards according to the level of risk;
• e) consider the diversity of the workforce and the needs of particular groups, as well as the
wider context of the organization;
17
• f) provide information on control measures and opportunities for improvement.
6.2 Objectives to address psychosocial risk
The organization should:
• a) establish measurable objectives consistent with the policy;
• b) develop and implement plans to ensure that these objectives can be achieved.
7 Support
7.1 Resources
The organization should establish, provide and maintain the resources needed to achieve its
objectives with respect to the management of psychosocial risk. The organization should consider the
human, financial, technological and other resources specific to its operations.
7.2 Competence
7.2.1 The organization should:
• a) develop the competence necessary to identify psychosocial hazards and manage
psychosocial risks (e.g. understanding how psychosocial hazards can interact with one
another and other hazards, and the nature and scope of their potential outcomes);
• b) take actions, including training and professional development as appropriate, to support
workers to acquire and maintain the necessary competence;
• c) ensure that workers and other relevant interested parties have the competence to
implement the measures and processes necessary for the prevention of psychosocial risks;
• d) ensure that workers and other relevant interested parties understand the processes for
reporting or raising concerns;
• e) seek relevant external advice if this knowledge is not available in the organization;
• f) evaluate the effectiveness of the actions taken to ensure competence;
• g) take into account the needs, experience, language skills, literacy and diversity of individual
workers.
7.2.2 The organization should establish the competence requirements for:
• a) top management and workers with line management responsibility;
• b) workers performing risk assessments;
• c) workers implementing control measures and other interventions (see 8.1.1);
• d) workers performing evaluation and reviews of the process and its outcomes.
The organization should retain documented information relating to competence, including training and
other actions taken, and consult workers when determining the competence needed for identifying,
preventing and managing psychosocial risks.
7.3 Awareness
7.3.1 As appropriate, the organization should inform workers and other relevant interested parties of
factors in the workplace that can:
• a) affect health, safety and well-being at work;
• b) potentially create or increase stigma and/or discrimination;
• c) reduce psychosocial risks;
• d) support their roles and responsibilities to promote health and safety and enhance wellbeing at work.
18
7.3.2 When developing awareness of psychosocial risk, the organization should take into account:
• a) the importance of top management support for reporting psychosocial hazards and
protection from reprisals for such reporting;
• b) actions that workers can take to address psychosocial hazards and how the organization is
expected to respond;
• c) the potential benefits of sharing experiences and best practice by workers and other
interested parties;
• d) existing knowledge and training of workers and other interested parties;
• e) the need to embed and integrate awareness of psychosocial risks in processes and
policies (e.g. during new worker orientation);
• f) opportunities provided by existing events and meetings (e.g. whole organization events,
regular staff meetings);
• g) the risks, opportunities and impacts arising from changes in the workplace;
• h) the need to identify and take actions to eliminate stigma and/or discrimination.
The organization should make workers and other interested parties aware of the actions it is taking to
manage psychosocial risks, including actions to encourage reporting of psychosocial hazards, reduce
fear of reprisals associated with reporting, and promote trust in its OH&S management system.
7.4 Communication
Communication is important because it demonstrates commitment to managing psychosocial risks,
promoting well-being at work, and informing workers and other interested parties of what is expected
from them, and what they can expect from the organization.
The organization should communicate to workers and other relevant interested parties information on
psychosocial risk that can be accessed, understood and used. When communicating, the organization
should:
• a) demonstrate top management commitment to other workers, to increase knowledge and
use of processes;
• b) provide opportunities for feedback to top management from workers on actions,
programmes and policies intended to facilitate worker involvement;
• c) outline the development of its processes to manage psychosocial risk and their
effectiveness;
• d) respond to the ideas and concerns of workers and other interested parties and their input
to the OH&S management system with respect to psychosocial risks;
• e) include information on how work-related changes can impact on health, safety and wellbeing at work;
• f) provide information from audits and other evaluations.
Relevant information should be accessible and adapted to the needs of the workers (e.g. in different
languages or using different media such as video clips or audio files).
7.5 Documented information
7.5.1 General
The organization’s OH&S management system should include documented information as necessary
for the effective management of psychosocial risks.
Documented information includes:
• a) processes for the management of psychosocial risk;
• b) details of roles, responsibilities and authorities;
• c) assessment(s) of psychosocial risks;
• d) results of monitoring, evaluation, control measures and their effectiveness;
19
• e) how legal requirements and other requirements are met.
7.5.2 Confidentiality
The organization should establish processes related to psychosocial risks that ensure confidentiality
of personal information with particular regard to relevant legal requirements and other requirements.
The organization should:
• a) maintain the confidentiality of documented and undocumented information with respect to
an individual worker’s experience of psychosocial risk;
• b) protect against disclosure of the outcomes following exposure to psychosocial hazards
(such as medical treatment, time away from work, flexible work arrangements) and medical
information;
• c) inform workers of any limits that apply to confidentiality.
8 Operation
8.1 Operational planning and control
8.1.1 General
8.1.1.1 The organization should plan, implement, control and maintain processes to adequately and
effectively manage psychosocial risks and new opportunities, including actions or activities to:
• a) eliminate hazards and reduce psychosocial risks by considering the best fit between tasks,
structures and work processes and the needs of workers;
• b) analyse the controls already in place to manage psychosocial risks and their effects on
individuals or the organization;
• c) review, analyse and evaluate existing management practices and worker support for
controlling psychosocial hazards, work-related stress and other associated health outcomes;
• d) adopt a comprehensive, long-term strategy that considers the organization’s policies,
structure, resources, existing systems and operations, and practices;
• e) design and manage work to prevent risks to psychological health and safety and to
promote well-being at work.
8.1.1.2 The organization should complete an assessment of psychosocial risks, taking into account
existing controls, to:
• a) determine whether these controls are adequate or need improvement;
• b) identify if new controls are required if the assessment of psychosocial risks has identified
actual or potential harm from exposure to psychosocial hazards;
• c) eliminate work-related psychosocial hazards wherever possible, and control associated
risks if elimination is not possible, following the principle of the hierarchy of controls
(see ISO 45001:2018, Clause 8).
8.1.1.3 When managing psychosocial risks, a combination of the following levels of intervention can
be used:
• a) primary: organizational level controls to prevent or reduce harmful effects and promote
well-being at work;
• b) secondary: increasing resources that assist workers to deal with psychosocial risks by
raising awareness and understanding through effective training and other appropriate
measures;
• c) tertiary: reducing the harmful effects of exposure to psychosocial hazards by implementing
rehabilitation programmes and taking other corrective and supportive actions.
20
NOTE 1 Some organizations have their own occupational health service or worker assistance
programmes. Organizations that do not have in-house expertise can seek assistance from competent
external sources, if necessary.
NOTE 2 The three levels of primary, secondary and tertiary interventions reflect the hierarchy of
controls to support effective psychosocial risk management.
8.1.2 Eliminating hazards, reducing OH&S risks and promoting well-being at work
8.1.2.1 Psychosocial risk control measures
Eliminating hazards and reducing psychosocial risks promotes well-being at work. There are various
strategies to manage psychosocial risks and promote OH&S. Strategies for eliminating hazards,
reducing psychosocial risks and promoting well-being should be developed in consultation with
workers and, where they exist, worker representatives.
8.1.2.2 Psychosocial risk control measures related to work organization
The organization should implement control measures for psychosocial risks related to work
organization. In many cases, this requires redesign of work processes, not only adjustment of tasks.
Measures can include:
• a) increasing workers’ control over the way they do their work, e.g. by introducing flexible
working, job-sharing, more consultation about working practices or enabling workers to
control the pace of work tasks;
• b) allowing breaks to manage fatigue, and restricting work-related contact via mobile phone
and email in non-working time;
• c) consulting workers and, where they exist, worker representatives about workplace changes
and how these can affect them;
• d) defining work roles, supervisory relationships and performance requirements to minimize
confusion and ambiguity;
• e) prioritizing tasks and allowing flexible time frames for completion;
• f) facilitating the development of competence and allocating work tasks to workers with
appropriate knowledge, skills and experience suitable to the complexity and duration of the
task;
• g) providing greater access to social support for workers who are working remotely or are
working in isolated work locations;
• h) limiting remote and/or isolated work, if appropriate;
• i) providing effective supervision, constructive feedback and guidance to workers;
• j) improving attitudes towards managing and reporting psychosocial risk, including workrelated stress, harassment, bullying and violence at work;
• k) providing practical support during peak workload periods (e.g. additional or more
experienced workers).
8.1.2.3 Psychosocial risk control measures related to social factors
The organization should implement control measures for psychosocial risks related to social factors at
work. Measures can include:
• a) increasing awareness of psychosocial risks and providing information and training to
workers on how to report them;
• b) encouraging early reporting of issues by workers by demonstrating the organization’s
commitment to providing a supportive, respectful work environment, and maintaining
confidentiality;
• c) establishing support measures for workers who are experiencing negative impacts from
exposure to psychosocial risks;
• d) developing organizational policies and guidance that outline expected work behaviours and
how unacceptable behaviour will be managed;
21
• e) providing specific instructions on how to manage foreseeable risks, how to respond if an
incident occurs, and how to provide post-incident assistance to workers;
• f) providing training to develop awareness and appropriate skills to identify psychosocial risks
and recognize early signs of work-related stress and ill-health;
• g) providing access to, or information about, support services, general occupational health
services, confidential debriefing, counselling and conflict mediation services;
• h) providing information to workers about their rights and responsibilities;
• i) recognizing and rewarding worker commitment and achievement;
• j) improving workplace culture through a range of integrated programmes (e.g. health and
safety management practices, social responsibility, environmental sustainability, community
engagement);
• k) promoting a workplace that is free of work-related violence and harassment;
• l) providing victims of work-related violence and harassment (including gender-based violence
and sexual harassment) with access to responsive and safe support services.
8.1.2.4 Psychosocial risk control measures related to work environment, equipment and
hazardous tasks
The organization should implement control measures for psychosocial risks related to work
environment, equipment and hazardous tasks, including:
• a) providing, and maintaining appropriate equipment for performing the work (e.g. manual
handling equipment) and improving equipment as necessary;
• b) improving workplace surroundings and physical workplace features to isolate or protect
workers from hazards (e.g. noise, lighting, vibration, temperature, chemicals);
• c) isolating or protecting workers from psychosocial hazards, e.g. with physical barriers to
reduce risk of violence;
• d) providing and requiring the use of appropriate and effective personal protective equipment
(PPE) where there are risks that cannot be minimized using more effective higher order
controls.
NOTE Appropriate PPE can reduce workers’ concerns about exposure to a range of other hazards
and can contribute to controlling and reducing psychosocial risks related to the work environment,
equipment and hazardous tasks (see Table 3).
8.1.2.5 Signs of exposure to psychosocial risk
The organization should enable workers to identify signs of exposure to psychosocial risks.
Examples at an individual and/or group level can include:
• a) changes in behaviour;
• b) social isolation or withdrawal, refusing offers of help or neglecting personal well-being
needs;
• c) increased absence from work or coming to work when ill;
• d) lack of engagement;
• e) reduced energy;
• f) high staff turnover;
• g) low quality performance or failure to complete tasks/assignments on time;
• h) reduced desire to work with others;
• i) conflicts, lack of willingness to co-operate, and bullying;
• j) increased frequency of incidents or errors.
8.1.3 Management of change
Organizational and work-related changes can influence psychosocial risks or create additional
psychosocial risks. The organization should establish, implement and maintain a process(es) for 
22
communication and control of changes that can impact health, safety and well-being at work,
including:
• a) changes to the organization’s objectives, activities, work processes and leadership, (e.g.
workplace locations and surroundings; equipment and resources; workforce and terms of
employment);
• b) changes to work tasks and organization (e.g. shift patterns, workflow, reporting lines) and
working conditions;
• c) changes to legal requirements and other requirements;
• d) changes in knowledge or information about psychosocial hazards and risks;
• e) developments in knowledge and technology, and the need to improve competence through
additional training;
The organization should involve workers and worker representatives, where they exist, at an early
stage of the change process and throughout the process, particularly during restructuring.
8.1.4 Procurement, contracting and outsourcing
Procurement of products and services and the contracting for, and outsourcing of, activities can affect
existing psychosocial risks and create new risks or new opportunities. Organizations should establish,
implement and maintain a process(es) to control psychosocial risks arising from exposure to hazards
related to procurement, contracting and outsourcing, which take into account:
• a) how the procurement of products and services creates these risks (e.g. through the
presence of visitors in the workplace or the scheduling of the delivery of products and
services impacting on the organization’s work schedules and workers’ workloads,
performance and training needs);
• b) how the engagement of contractors can impact workplace culture, worker roles and
expectations;
• c) how the outsourcing of activities impacts on schedules, workloads, changes in work tasks,
job security, supervision or the quality of work;
• d) how the shared duty to protect and promote the health, safety and well-being of workers is
managed by the organization, its contractors and suppliers, and other interested parties
8.2 Emergency preparedness and response
The organization should take into account that emergencies in the workplace can present
psychosocial risks (e.g. through trauma, threats to life). Exposure to psychosocial risks can also
create emergency situations (e.g. violence, threats) for other workers and other interested parties.
To ensure health, safety and well-being at work and manage psychosocial risk in the event of an
emergency (e.g. natural disaster, emerging infectious diseases, suicide of a colleague, incidents,
crises, terror, threats, robbery, dismissals, shut-downs, fire), the organization should:
• a) recognize that a wide range of emergency situations can impact psychological health,
safety and well-being;
• b) prepare for inclusion of appropriate care in the planned response to emergency situations;
• c) establish priorities when responding to the needs of workers and other interested parties as
appropriate;
• d) use competent workers, emergency services or other appropriate specialists to respond to
the emergency situation and seek additional advice and support as necessary.
8.3 Rehabilitation and return to work
The organization should design and implement appropriate rehabilitation and return-to-work
programmes.
23
Rehabilitation and return-to-work programmes aim to provide appropriate support to workers
experiencing negative impact of exposure to psychosocial hazards, including where this has resulted
in absence from work. When designing these programmes, the organization should take into account
that workers can be at increased potential for exposure to psychosocial risks as part of the return to
work process. For example, work adjustments to facilitate return to work can result in changes to work
tasks, relationships and social interaction, supervision, work culture, and perceptions of achievement
and value at work. The potential for increased exposure to psychosocial risks applies to workers who
are returning to work regardless of the reason for their absence.
An early and supportive response to negatively affected workers is important. The organizations can
encourage early reporting of issues by demonstrating commitment to maintaining confidentiality and
providing a supportive, respectful work environment (see Clause 5).
The potential for exposure to psychosocial risks during return to work should be managed in a
manner consistent with how all psychosocial risks should be prevented and managed.
Examples of measures to improve rehabilitation and return to work include:
• a) providing access to, or information about, general occupational health services, whether
internal or external to the organization;
• b) providing access to, or information about, confidential debriefing, counselling services,
conflict mediation services, and access to relevant assessment(s) etc.;
• c) talking with an affected worker to understand and plan for reasonable work adjustments to
support return to work;
• d) ensuring workers with management roles are competent to manage the impact of exposure
to psychosocial hazards and understand applicable legal requirements and other
requirements as workers return to work;
• e) regularly monitoring rehabilitation and return to work programmes to establish if there are
new or previously unidentified risks;
• f) consulting with other relevant interested parties, including occupational health
professionals, in managing the return to work process regarding progress and necessary
changes to the return to work programme.
9 Performance evaluation
9.1 Monitoring, measurement, analysis and performance evaluation
9.1.1 An organization should establish and implement a systematic approach for monitoring and
measuring activities related to managing psychosocial risk and the performance of the OH&S
management system.
Performance monitoring and measurement should:
• a) determine the extent to which the policy is complied with and objectives are met;
• b) provide data on activities related to psychological health and safety in the workplace,
recognizing the need for confidentiality of personal information;
• c) determine if the processes for psychosocial hazard identification and assessment of risk
are in place and controls are operating effectively (e.g. taking into account signs of worker
exposure to psychosocial risk as set out in 8.1.2.5);
• d) provide the basis for decisions about improvements related to health, safety and well-being
at work;
• e) determine the extent to which the organization has fulfilled legal requirements and other
requirements;
• f) provide information on the OH&S management system’s performance in managing
psychosocial risks.
The organization should develop appropriate qualitative and quantitative measures in consultation
and with participation of workers and, where they exist, their representatives.
24
9.1.2 The organization should maintain, monitor, review and revise as necessary the control
measures for psychosocial risks to ensure they remain effective. Reviews should occur:
• a) if a new hazard or risk is identified;
• b) if a control measure is not adequate to minimize the risk;
• c) before a significant workplace change occurs (e.g. a change to the work environment or
work systems);
• d) where consultation indicates a review is necessary or workers or worker representatives
request a review.
The organization should retain appropriate documented information as evidence of the results of
monitoring, measurement and performance evaluation.
The organization should establish key performance indicators and collect and analyse relevant data.
Leading indicators allow for prediction of future performance and should be used in addition to lagging
indicators that indicate improvement against past performance.
9.2 Internal audit
The organization should:
• a) conduct internal audits at planned intervals including consideration of psychosocial risks;
• b) use the findings to assess the effectiveness of the management of psychosocial risks;
• c) identify gaps in performance to identify opportunities to continually improve the
management of psychosocial risks.
9.3 Management review
9.3.1 Management review ensures that top management remains informed on psychosocial risk
performance on a regular basis and the extent to which the organization has met its policy and
objectives for the management of psychosocial risks. The results from monitoring and measuring
provide the basis for analysis during the management review process and are used to evaluate the
overall adequacy, suitability and effectiveness of its activities to manage psychosocial risk. Evidencebased decision-making is key for continually improving the effectiveness of the OH&S management
system.
Top management should:
• a) review the organization’s management of psychosocial risk at planned intervals;
• b) use the results from the analysis and evaluation during the management review process;
• c) evaluate the overall adequacy, suitability and effectiveness of its activities to manage
psychosocial risk;
• d) assess opportunities for improvement and the need for changes, and use the results of the
management review as the basis for continual improvement activities;
• e) retain documented information of the management reviews.
9.3.2 Input to management reviews relating to psychosocial risk should include:
• a) results of audits and evaluations of compliance with applicable legal requirements and with
other requirements to which the organization subscribes;
• b) the results of participation and consultation;
• c) the psychosocial risk performance of the organization;
• d) OH&S data and other data (e.g. support services, disability plans, compensation schemes);
• e) the status of incident investigations and corrective actions taken to prevent psychosocial
risks to workers.
Top management should communicate relevant results of the management review in relation to
psychosocial risk to workers and other interested parties, as appropriate.
25
10 Improvement
10.1 General
As it implements actions to continually improve the OH&S management system and performance in
relation to psychosocial risk, the organization should take into account the outcome of:
• a) performance evaluations;
• b) incident reports;
• c) consultation with and recommendations from workers and, where they exist, worker
representatives;
• d) audits;
• e) management reviews.
The organization should evaluate the effectiveness of improvement actions.
10.2 Incident, nonconformity and corrective action
The organization should:
• a) have a process to address nonconformities and incidents related to psychosocial risk;
• b) consider developing a specific process to investigate nonconformities and incidents given
the sensitive nature of incidents that impact on psychological health, safety and well-being at
work;
• c) define processes for the reporting of nonconformity and incidents that maintain
confidentiality and provide for a timely response to reports;
• d) encourage and support reporting to reduce fear of reprisals;
• e) use information gained from investigations and recommendations for corrective actions to
identify opportunities for improvement.
NOTE A nonconformity occurs whenever there is an actual or potential lack of conformity to the
requirements of the organization’s OH&S management system. An incident occurs whenever there is
an actual, or potential for, injury or ill health to a worker.
10.3 Continual improvement
The organization should:
• a) gather information on the opportunities for improvement in the management of
psychosocial risks, fulfilment of its legal requirements and other requirements, and
achievement of its OH&S objectives as part of its continual improvement process;
• b) evaluate opportunities to implement changes and give priority to those that have the
greatest potential for improving psychological health, safety and well-being in the workplace.

Ten Things You Can Do for Your Mental Health
Man playing basketball
Try these tips to keep your balance, or re-balance yourself.*

1. Value yourself:
Treat yourself with kindness and respect, and avoid self-criticism. Make time for your hobbies and favorite projects, or broaden your horizons. Do a daily crossword puzzle, plant a garden, take dance lessons, learn to play an instrument or become fluent in another language.

2. Take care of your body:
Taking care of yourself physically can improve your mental health. Be sure to:

Eat nutritious meals
Avoid smoking and vaping-- see Cessation Help
Drink plenty of water
Exercise, which helps decrease depression and anxiety and improve moods
Get enough sleep. Researchers believe that lack of sleep contributes to a high rate of depression in college students. 
3. Surround yourself with good people:
People with strong family or social connections are generally healthier than those who lack a support network. Make plans with supportive family members and friends, or seek out activities where you can meet new people, such as a club, class or support group.

4. Give yourself:
Volunteer your time and energy to help someone else. You'll feel good about doing something tangible to help someone in need — and it's a great way to meet new people. See Fun and Cheap Things to do in Ann Arbor for ideas.

5. Learn how to deal with stress:
Like it or not, stress is a part of life. Practice good coping skills: Try One-Minute Stress Strategies, do Tai Chi, exercise, take a nature walk, play with your pet or try journal writing as a stress reducer. Also, remember to smile and see the humor in life. Research shows that laughter can boost your immune system, ease pain, relax your body and reduce stress.

6. Quiet your mind:
Try meditating, Mindfulness and/or prayer. Relaxation exercises and prayer can improve your state of mind and outlook on life. In fact, research shows that meditation may help you feel calm and enhance the effects of therapy. To get connected, see spiritual resources on Personal Well-being for Students

7. Set realistic goals:
Decide what you want to achieve academically, professionally and personally, and write down the steps you need to realize your goals. Aim high, but be realistic and don't over-schedule. You'll enjoy a tremendous sense of accomplishment and self-worth as you progress toward your goal. Wellness Coaching, free to U-M students, can help you develop goals and stay on track. 

8. Break up the monotony:
Although our routines make us more efficient and enhance our feelings of security and safety, a little change of pace can perk up a tedious schedule. Alter your jogging route, plan a road-trip, take a walk in a different park, hang some new pictures or try a new restaurant. See Rejuvenation 101 for more ideas.

9. Avoid alcohol and other drugs:
Keep alcohol use to a minimum and avoid other drugs. Sometimes people use alcohol and other drugs to "self-medicate" but in reality, alcohol and other drugs only aggravate problems. For more information, see Alcohol and Other Drugs.

10. Get help when you need it:
Seeking help is a sign of strength — not a weakness. And it is important to remember that treatment is effective. People who get appropriate care can recover from mental illness and addiction and lead full, rewarding lives. See Resources for Stress and Mental Health for campus and community resources.

Mental disorders are one of the most prevalent dysfunctions of today’s modern humans. According to estimates, one in four people will suffer from mental health disorders at one point in their lives. This is a huge proportion of society, and it says a lot about the importance we should give to this healthcare sector, no matter where we are, who we are and what we do.[1]

Mental health issues are not a characteristic of certain social groups, as they can affect people of all educatie-mental-healthonal backgrounds, ethnicities, professions, social status, age, or gender.

While they often go undiscussed, providers can play a critical role in educating the public about their impacts, what they look like, and the mental health solutions that are available.

Mental Health Statistics in the US
To realize how much we should focus as a society on educating the average person about mental illness and invest our public and private resources in mental health, let’s take a look at the most recent statistics on the subject, both globally and in the US.

As mentioned before, estimates show that about one in four people will suffer from mental or neurological disorders at one point in their lives.[1] According to a 2001 WHO press release, there were approximately 450 million people suffering from such conditions even back in 2001, and nearly two-thirds did not seek mental treatment.

Mental Health Solutions in the US
NAMI (the National Alliance on Mental Illness), one of the most important US organizations in the field, published updated statistics in the US, and they are still worrying, even if lately we had progressed in this domain.

Let’s lay down a few of the NAMI statistics:[2]

20.6% of US adults (one in five people) experience mental illness yearly
Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death in young people (aged 10-34)
5.2% of US adults (one in 20 people) experience serious mental illness yearly, and
16.5% of US youth aged 6-17 (one in six people) experience a mental health disorder yearly
These figures represent many millions – an indicator of how prevalent such conditions can be. With mental illness such a common occurrence, it’s important that it is seen and treated effectively. Unfortunately, these conditions are often associated with stigma, and treatment is not always available or affordable.

In fact, NAMI states, the average delay between the onset of mental illness symptoms and getting treatment is 11 years. More than half of adults with mental illness are not even getting treatment, even those with serious mental illnesses, due to no insurance coverage or other reasons.

What Are The Most Common Mental Illnesses?
If you want to know which conditions are seen most often and how many people are believed to suffer from them, here is the list published by NAMI:

1% – Anxiety Disorders
2% – Major Depressive Episode
6% – PTSD
8% – Bipolar Disorder
4% – Borderline Personality Disorder.
According to the National Institute of Mental Health’s 2017 survey of U.S. adults, mental health illnesses were most prevalent among:[3]

18-25-year-olds (25.8%)
Females (22.3%), and
Adults reporting two or more races (28.6%).
Clearly, mental health treatment plays an important role in society – but why, exactly?

Mental Health Illnesses: Impacts on Society
Mental disorders and conditions greatly affect a person’s life, because they can insinuate and manifest themselves in any type of situation. On top of this unpredictability, they are often associated with a number of other diseases.

Personal Impacts
At the individual level, mental health solutions help to address very real physiological and psychological effects.

For example:

Cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, which research indicates are more likely to be present in persons with depression[4]
Young people suffering from depression are more likely than their peers to drop out of school,[5] and
A significant proportion of US adults with mental illness are also suffering from substance abuse, which in turn leads to other associated general and mental health conditions.[6]
Community Impacts
How mental illness affects communities:

37% of incarcerated adults in the US suffer from mental illness[7]
A suggested 70% of the youth in juvenile correction centers suffer from mental illness[8]
Serious mental illness causes a prejudice of over $190 billion each year to the US economy[2]
As you can see, and the numbers speak for themselves, mental illness is highly prevalent all over the world and in the US. Not only does it affect patients individually, but it takes its toll on society as a whole.

Educating ourselves, however, on symptoms and mental health solutions, enables communities and society to contribute to better mental healthcare systems.

Current Mental Health Solutions: Challenges Faced
As published by the WHO in their press release, many mental health patients experience problems stemming from the fact that governments don’t implement mental health programs, don’t allocate sufficient resources for treating mental illnesses, and don’t protect the most vulnerable and exposed group: the poor.

Educating ourselves on symptoms and mental health solutions, enables communities and society to contribute to better mental healthcare systems.
One worrying statistic shows that 60% of US counties don’t even have a practicing psychiatrist on their territory. This psychiatrist shortage reflects on the general health of the population and its future.

Unfortunately, as time goes by, the need for more mental health professionals increases, and the government should actively try to cover this gap.

Worldwide, the mental health situation is not looking good, as many countries don’t have a mental health program, don’t allocate sufficient funds for this field, and don’t make the basic treatment available.

Let’s go through the main challenges faced by the US healthcare system when it comes to mental health.

Lack of Available Mental Health Resources
As noted, a large number of US counties don’t even have a psychiatry practitioner, or psychologists, or social workers.

Across the world, the WHO identifies lack of availability as a key barrier to proper mental healthcare, preventing many from seeking treatment due to:[9]

Lack of insurance coverage
Shortage of inpatient resources
Policy and financing gaps
Inadequate health reforms,
And more.
As a result, there are increasing calls at the global level for improved service availability and accessibility, to move toward less disparate mental health programs.

Stigma and Perceived Stigma
Educating the public is essential in ensuring that patients will seek treatment for their mental health disorders.

Efforts must be made in order to publicly speak about the signs of mental health, where to seek treatment, and how to talk to our children about it. Part of this need is shown by the fact that many people are unaware that their health insurance policy covers mental health issues.

Lack of Mental Healthcare Regulations
Regulators of mental health services are challenged by the fact that the number of factors they need to evaluate is increasing.

At the same time, the WHO points out that a lack of homogenous regulation for mental health systems and training programs across the country, which make for variable quality of treatment.

Mental Health Solutions: What Are They?
We have presented a general picture of the mental healthcare needs in the US and the challenges faced by the mental healthcare system, in order to better understand the possible solutions.

Among the medical and blended care communities, research points to a general consensus on the salience of several key approaches. These include:

Early Intervention and Prevention
Greater Accessibility to Mental Healthcare Solutions
Involvement from Non-medical Organizations
Patient Outreach, and
Regulating digital mental health applications
Early Intervention and Prevention
In order to minimize the damage made by mental health on a person’s life, but also on the community they are part of, institutions must take more preventive actions.[10] By associating with non-clinical organizations, such as schools, companies, non-profit organizations dedicated to certain social challenges, mental healthcare providers can intervene faster and lead to a lower number of cases overall.

If early signs are correctly identified as symptoms of mental health disorders, or as a possible ground for developing such a disorder, treatments are typically much more affordable.

Quenza Mental Health Solutions Questionnaire Example

Prevention is also key to reducing mental healthcare costs, and ideally, should take place at all societal levels. This is where clinics and practices can make a positive impact by making screenings, questionnaires, and assessments widely available, as we’ve used Quenza’s custom form tools to illustrate above.

Accessibility
Calls to make mental health more accessible to all US patients center predominantly on large mental health institutions, and are concerned with the provision of more community-based solutions and remote services.

For patients living in remote areas of the country, finding a mental health professional is really challenging. In the same areas, the associated stigma is also more prevalent, making patients less likely to reach out for help.

Even when an area is served by a psychiatrist or psychologist, the number of people they provide services to is so large, that the doctor might be overwhelmed, and the patient is left with little to no option in terms of choosing who to be treated by. This is one of the key drivers behind the growth of affordable, location-independent teletherapy and virtual care services.

Involvement from Non-medical Organizations
When it comes to implementing mental health solutions, community involvement has a considerable role to play at the societal level. Healthcare practitioners can work toward increasing the reach and impact of available solutions by involving key community stakeholders – particularly in their outreach programs.

Examples include:

Religious institutions
Schools
Large and local companies
NGOs
Family organizations, and more to play a very helpful role in prevention and early intervention.
Any member of the community can contribute to better mental health services by initiating community dialogues about specific mental health issues and what can be done about them.

By treating mental health as a priority in your community, and by addressing it through multiple fronts, you can make the support network stronger and larger.

Patient Outreach
For many mental health disorders, ongoing treatment is essential. Patient outreach is extremely important in promoting long-term mental health, as interruptions or inadequate treatment can often worsen mental health conditions.

In many cases, a risk still exists that patients won’t even be diagnosed or receive treatment. Patient outreach programs in mental healthcare are dedicated to finding a way to address the needs of populations at risk, such as low-income or ethnic minorities.

Quenza Patient Outreach Mental Health Solutions

Quenza Mental Health Solutions Mindfulness

As we’ve illustrated, mental health software such as Quenza allows practices to design relevant content for a demographic or region. In our example, we’ve tailored a mindfulness meditation and yoga campaign for stressed-out remote-working patients.

Our fitness example might be sent to older adults that are at higher risk of arthritis or joint pain to raise awareness about our occupational therapy solutions. The second might be a free resource for all our patients during stressful times of the year, like the holidays.

Regulating Mental Health Applications
It’s clear that digital clinical solutions are incredibly effective at tackling behavioral issues, but this need has been seen as an opportunity for many people to offer their services online.

In the digital world, it’s easy to find a so-called expert online, but the onus lies on patients to ask – does a specific mental health app provide quality, scientifically valid mental health services?

Regulating digital mental health is very important and not so easy to implement, but major steps were taken in this direction through the HIPAA act, PDT (Prescription Digital Therapeutics), and other initiatives that make online consultations and treatment reliable.

As researchers point out, it’s equally important for legislation to reflect the growth in popularity of virtual care solutions, as digital behavioral therapy more accessible and more reliable.

This is further complicated by the fact that laws regarding the practice of telepsychology and e-therapy vary in each state, although with more and more online mental health solutions, we may see more standardization in the field.[11]

Telemedicine not only eliminates the distance between patients and medical providers, but it also decreases costs and encourages patient engagement.
Digital Mental Health Services
At first glance, the very first issue that has to be addressed when dealing with mental health care is to make it more accessible, by bringing patients closer to mental health providers.

Funding is also problematic, as many people with mental health problems are worried that they won’t be able to afford the treatment, and accept their limited functionality.

Telehealth has taken off in the last decades, and mental health is one of the main fields that benefits from it.

Through electronic behavioral health systems, mobile therapy solutions, e-clinics and more, telemedicine not only eliminates the distance between patients and medical providers, but it also decreases costs and encourages patient health engagement.

e-Therapy: What’s Next?
What the field of telepsychology still lacks are strict regulations designed to make online mental health services more trustworthy, while generating more patient demand practitioner adoption.

As more funds and research are invested into digital mental health solutions, patients across the country stand a better chance at obtaining the treatment they need to manage their mental health.

Telehealth needs to be more widely viewed as a means to:

Find the right professional in a timely manner
Ease treatment processes for more people
Engage more patients, reducing treatment dropout rates and encouraging patient retention
Reach lesser served demographics and geographical regions, and
Reduce the cost of necessary treatments for more patients.
Final Thoughts
Public discussions about mental health have become more important for providers and patients alike, a promising sign that mental health solutions are becoming a more pressing social issue.

While the challenges are still huge for many patients with mental health issues, increasing research and awareness has led to some significant steps forward.

Among them, digital solutions such as e-therapy, blended care, and more offer myriad opportunities for their valuable role in prevention, engagement, and more. As it stands, the way to better services lies in educating the public about both mental health illnesses, and all the available solutions.

We hope you found uncovered plenty of helpful tips in this article to apply in your practice. Don’t forget to turn your knowledge into better patient health when you try out Quenza for $1.

GETTY
Deloitte currently projects the global spending on mobile mental health apps alone will amount to almost $500 million in 2022, up from less than $300 million in 2021. And we can anticipate the total market for software solutions for mental conditions will be even larger. The global market for mental health software was estimated to be $1.9 billion in 2020, and it's expected to reach $4.5 billion by 2026.

Key Facts On Mental Health

Mental health is a serious social and economic issue. According to the WHO, approximately 20% of the world’s population currently have a mental health condition, and this number is growing due to the ageing of the population we are seeing almost universally.

The Covid-19 pandemic has also had a detrimental effect on global mental health. Although the overall suicide rate does not seem to have increased so far in high-income countries, the situation in developing countries is different. The International Journal of Mental Health Systems outlines that 85% of people with mental disorders do not receive appropriate care in low- and medium-income countries due to the shortage of professionals and ubiquitous gaps in the infrastructure.

Here are four business solutions to these challenges provided by digital mental health company models.

1. Telemental Health

Telemental health is one essential area to explore. It has been proven effective by multiple studies, such as in these two large meta-analyses conducted both before and during the pandemic. The National Alliance on Mental Health has promoted the use of telemedicine as a tool for improving access to mental health. A 2021 survey of the American Psychiatric Association shows that 38% of Americans approached teleservices for mental issues versus 31% in 2020, indicating the growing rate of satisfaction.

2. The Internet Of Medical Things (IoMT)

Modern wearables and smartphones can report an extensive amount of relevant patient data for clinical purposes. Thus, tracking a person’s location via satellites or accelerometer sensors can help detect sedentary life which may highlight depression. One such tool is Juli.co.

Apps like Embrace and myCareCentric Epilepsy employ wristbands to track heart rate, skin conductance and movements to help people with epilepsy detect seizures earlier.

Another common way to access mental wellness is to track a patient’s interactions with an app. One joint product offered by Takeda Pharmaceuticals and Cognition Kit is an Apple Watch app monitoring the daily mood and cognition of patients with depressive disorders. Most mental health IoMT solutions are not invasive, which opens a great opportunity for businesses focusing on prevention, screening, assessment and treatment of mental disorders.

Probably the most significant among IoMT tools in mental health are devices from Medtronic and Abbott. These are able to obtain brain signals via implanted deep brain stimulation electrodes and transmit comprehensive information about the real-time brain activity to healthcare providers, allowing better management for patients with Parkinson’s disease.

3. Mental Health Data Management And Communication Tools

Since 2005, the WHO has been implementing Mental Health Information Systems (MHIS) for storing relevant information in all possible data layers (episode, facility and system levels). The collection, qualitative analysis and evaluation of big data and statistics on mental disorders can allow healthcare providers to improve patient treatment regimens, increase the accuracy of decisions and reduce costs.

One opportunity here has arisen in cognitive behavioral therapy digital platforms which use evidence-based interactive exercises, audio, videos and questionnaires. One such example of communication with proven effectiveness is Good Days Ahead.

Electronic emotional support programs can also be provided via less expensive text-based services such as a Canadian SaskWell, implemented as a part of a Covid-19 lockdown depression prevention program.

4. AI And ML Solutions

As stated previously, AI and ML in mental health are used for processing data from wearables and mobile devices using big data analysis. But their potential can be used to an even greater extent, as seen in these examples:

• Chatbots and virtual therapists. ​​Woebot, a tool for coping with anxiety and depression, allows patients to assess their moods and receive support 24/7, significantly reducing relapses within 2-3 weeks of use. It has language localization and focuses on multi-topic human-like communication. The virtual therapist Ellie developed by ICT helps veterans cope with depression and post-traumatic stress. This app is able to recognize both verbal and non-verbal reactions of the interlocutor.

• ML algorithms. These can be used to analyze EMR and data of people with depression, allowing healthcare professionals insights to help determine predictions of suicide.

• Social networks monitoring. This can afford specialists information about the mental state of patients. Facebook posts, individual expressions and emoticons could help identify symptoms of depression three months before the need for treatment.

• Detection of eye movement and blinking, speech patterns and voice features. These can give great insights into the mental state of depressed patients.

• Smartphone usage tracking. Useful monitoring tools such as Boston's Cogito Companion app can process call logs, text frequency and geolocation to warn specialists about symptoms of mental disorders.

• The emerging concept of digital therapeutics. Defining the clinical effectiveness and safety of mental health applications allows for their prescription by professionals. One working example of this is in Germany's DiGA Fast Track, whose solutions have been proven effective in clinical trials.

A Few Best Practices

Drawing from my research and experience, here are a few best practices I would like to share with mental health app developers:

• Consider implementing self-monitoring features to help users track their improvements over time.

• Leverage feature customization (font size, color, background, layout, etc.), as these should allow for individual user preferences according to mental health needs.

• Ensure easy verification of the reliability and scientific relevance of the content of your mental health app.

• Offer peer-to-peer support and the opportunity to share experiences.

In Conclusion

As the world continues to struggle with crises and accessibility, a number and variety of mental health tech solutions arises. This may just be the beginning of a new chapter in exciting new mental health tech solutions.

The Top Ten Richest People In The World
PAUL HENNESSY/GETTY IMAGES
The ranks of the wealthiest people on the planet include 8 self-made Americans, a French luxury goods tycoon and a Mexican telecom magnate.
Last update: July 1, 2023, 10 A.M. EDT
Billionaires are some of the most powerful people on Earth, wielding significant influence over huge parts of the global economy and playing key roles in everything from international politics and media to philanthropy and scientific innovation. Many have created companies that employ tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of employees around the world and are behind some of the best known brands, including Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Google and Nike. The majority are self-made, meaning they created their fortunes themselves, rather than inheriting them. Others, like Rupert Murdoch and Mukesh Ambani, had a bit more of a leg up early on by joining their family businesses, but expanded their fortunes greatly and went on to create empires in their respective industries.

Forbes has been keeping track of the world’s billionaires since 1987. This year, we found 2,640 of them for our annual list. Throughout the year, we update their fortunes on a daily basis. Many billionaires hold much of their net worth in the stock of the company they founded. As that stock price moves, their fortune moves along with it. For most of 2023, French luxury goods magnate Bernard Arnault was the world’s richest person, per Forbes—but that changed on June 8, 2023, when Tesla CEO Elon Musk overtook Arnault to become No. 1 in the world again, worth nearly $238 billion. As of July 1, 2023, Musk is still the world’s richest person—a position he also held for much of 2022.

Surging shares of Meta Platforms—which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp—landed Mark Zuckerberg back among the world’s top ten richest for the first time since January 2022. Meta stock lost nearly two-thirds of its value over the course of 2022, but has staged an impressive rebound, rising 130% in the first half of 2023. As of July 1, Zuckerberg is the world’s ninth richest, worth nearly $102 billion, per Forbes’ estimates.





Here are the 10 richest people in the world as of July 1, 2023 at 10 a.m. Eastern time, according to Forbes.

Stock prices fluctuate routinely, so these net worths may change on a daily basis. Forbes tracks the daily changes on our Real Time list of billionaires.

1. Elon Musk
Net worth: $237.7 B
Source: Tesla, SpaceX, Twitter
Age: 51
Residence: Austin, Texas
Citizenship: U.S.
Musk is CEO of electric car company Tesla, rocket firm SpaceX and social media company Twitter. He owns 23% of Tesla between stock and options, but has pledged more than half of his stock as collateral for loans. The car company accounts for about two-thirds of his fortune. He bought Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022 and owns an estimated 74% of the social media company, which is now worth less than half what he paid for it. His fortune rose by $27.5 billion between May 1, 2023 and June 1, 2023, mostly due to a more than 25% rise in the share price of Tesla.

Originally from South Africa, Musk moved to Canada before his 18th birthday, worked a variety of jobs, enrolled at Queen’s University in Ontario and then transferred to University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in economics.

In 2000, he merged an online bank he cofounded, X.com with a similar outfit cofounded by Peter Thiel to form PayPal, which eBay bought in 2002 for $1.4 billion. He founded SpaceX in 2002 in El Segundo, near Los Angeles. In 2004 he joined Tesla as an investor and chairman, a year after it was founded; he was later granted the cofounder title. Musk, who became CEO of Tesla in 2008, took the company public in 2010. Its market capitalization soared during 2020 and 2021. In September 2021, Musk became the world’s richest person. In November 2021, his fortune peaked at a whopping $320 billion.

Musk became the world’s richest person on June 8, 2023 and still ranks No. 1 on July 1. Tesla shares have risen by more than 140% in the first half of 2023, propelling Musk’s fortune higher. Musk was also the world’s richest person for most of 2022—until December, when a drop in Tesla’s share price pushed down the value of his fortune.




JAMEL TOPPIN FOR FORBES
2. Bernard Arnault
Net worth: $231.9 B
Source: LVMH/ luxury goods
Age: 74
Residence: Paris
Citizenship: France
Bernard Arnault is CEO and chairman of LVMH, the largest luxury goods company in the world with some 70 fashion and cosmetics brands. Among its most notable: Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Moet & Chandon and Sephora. In January 2021, LVMH acquired jeweler Tiffany & Co. for $15.8 billion.

Arnault’s father made millions in the construction business; to get his start, Arnault used $15 million of that fortune to buy Christian Dior.

All five of Arnault’s children work in parts of the LVMH empire. In January 2023, Arnault appointed his daughter Delphine to run Dior, the second largest brand in the group.

Arnault was the world’s richest person for most of the first half of 2023; he fell to No. 2 on June 8, 2023. As of July 1, Arnault is worth $5.8 billion less than Elon Musk, per Forbes’ estimates.


MICHAEL PRINCE FOR FORBES
3. Jeff Bezos
Net worth: $153 B
Source: Amazon
Age: 59
Residence: Medina, Washington
Citizenship: U.S.
Jeff Bezos stepped down as CEO of e-commerce giant Amazon in July 2021 but remains chairman; that same month he went to space on a rocket built by private rocket company Blue Origin, which he founded and has funded with billions of dollars. Between June 1 and July 1, 2023 his fortune rose by nearly $10 billion.

Bezos founded online retailer Amazon.com in his garage in Seattle in 1994, after he left a job in New York at hedge fund D.E. Shaw. Amazon began as an online bookseller at a time when few people bought goods online. The company grew to dominate cloud storage and moved into movie and series production to feed Amazon Prime Video.

Bezos overtook Bill Gates to become the richest person in the world in July 2017. He and Gates traded the number one and number two richest spots off and on. Bezos was the world’s richest person on Forbes’ list of the World’s Billionaires from 2018 through 2021; he dropped to second richest on the 2022 billionaires list. He dropped to fourth richest but moved back to No. 3 on January 25, 2023 as the fortune of India’s Gautam Adani (formerly No. 3 richest) fell.

In 2019, Bezos and his wife MacKenzie divorced; as part of the settlement, she got 4% of Amazon’s shares and he kept 12%. He has since sold more of his stake and owns just under 10% of the company. Since Amazon went public in 1997, Forbes calculates that he has sold more than $27 billion worth of his stock. Through his Bezos Expeditions he has invested in an array of companies, including Airbnb and software firm Workday.

4. Larry Ellison
Net worth: $149.2 B
Source: Oracle
Age: 78
Residence: Lanai, Hawaii
Citizenship: U.S.
Larry Ellison cofounded software firm Oracle in 1977 and ran it as CEO until 2014; he now serves as chairman and Chief Technology Officer of the company. Over the years Oracle has made a series of large acquisitions, buying Sun Microsystems in 2010.

In 2012, Ellison bought the Hawaiian island of Lanai for $300 million. He moved from California to Lanai in 2020. Ellison invested in Tesla and served on the board of the car company from 2018 through August 2022.

For eight days in June 2023, Ellison overtook Jeff Bezos as the third richest person in the world following a rise in Oracle’s share price. Shares then receded and Ellison fell back to fourth richest. Still, his fortune increased by nearly $17 billion between June 1 and July 1, 2023.


5. Bill Gates
Net worth: $119.3 B
Source: Microsoft, investments
Age: 67
Residence: Medina, Washington
Citizenship: U.S.
As a teenager, Gates became passionate about computer programming. He dropped out of Harvard to cofound software firm Microsoft with his high school friend Paul Allen in 1975, creating one of the first software programs available for the nascent personal computer industry. He was CEO of the company for 25 years and remained chairman until 2014. He eventually stepped off the board in 2020 but told Forbes in early 2023 that he still spends about 10% of his time consulting with teams at Microsoft. These days he has investments in dozens of companies including waste removal firm Republic Services and agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co., and is one of the largest owners of farmland in the U.S.

Forbes first listed Gates as a billionaire in 1987; he was the richest person in the world from 1995 through 2017 (except in 2008 and from 2010 through 2013). Largely due to the $59 billion he has donated to the Gates Foundation, including a $20 billion gift in July 2022, he was overtaken as the world’s richest person in 2018 by Jeff Bezos. He and Melinda French Gates divorced in 2021; she received at least $6 billion in stock as part of the divorce settlement. Forbes estimates that Gates’ fortune increased by $5.3 billion from June 1 to July 1, 2023.

6. Warren Buffett
Net worth: $111.9

Age: 92
Residence: Omaha, Nebraska
Citizenship: U.S.
Known as the "Oracle of Omaha," Warren Buffett is one of the most successful investors of all time. He runs investing conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, which owns dozens of companies, including insurer Geico, battery maker Duracell and restaurant chain Dairy Queen. The son of a U.S. congressman, he first bought stock at age 11 and first filed taxes at age 13.

Buffett created the Giving Pledge with Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates in 2010, asking billionaires to commit to give away at least half their fortune to charitable groups. Buffett has said he would donate 99% of his fortune. So far he’s donated $51.5 billion in Berkshire Hathaway stock to the Gates Foundation and his kids’ foundations. That makes him the most generous billionaire on the planet. Despite giving away $4.6 billion worth of his Berkshire Hathaway shares in mid-June, his fortune rose by $2.2 billion in the month through July 1, 2023 as a result of a 5% increase in the price of Berkshire Hathaway Class A shares.

Ballmer, a classmate of Bill Gates at Harvard University, ran Microsoft as its CEO from 2000 to 2014. He joined Microsoft as employee number 30 in 1980 after dropping out of the MBA program at Stanford University.

The year that Ballmer retired from Microsoft, he purchased the Los Angeles Clippers team for $2 billion—a record high for an NBA team at the time. Forbes now values the team at $3.9 billion.

Ballmer’s fortune grew by an estimated $3.1 billion during June 2023, propelled in part by a rise in the price of Microsoft shares.

Zuckerberg cofounded Facebook—now called Meta Platforms—when he was a student at Harvard University. It has grown to be the world’s largest social network, with nearly 3 billion users. The company also owns Instagram and WhatsApp. Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta Platforms, took the company public in 2012 and still owns about 13% of it. He and his wife Priscilla Chan have pledged to direct 99% of their stock in the company toward measures that promote human potential. One effort is to develop tools to help others cure, manage or prevent all disease; Zuckerberg and Chan spoke to Forbes earlier this year about their efforts.

Zuckerberg joins the world’s top 10 richest this month for the first time since January 2022, as the result of a rise in the price of Meta Platforms’ stock.
